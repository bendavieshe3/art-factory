# Testing Strategy and Implementation Guide

## Overview

Art Factory maintains a comprehensive Django-first testing approach that balances thorough coverage with sustainable development practices. This document outlines our testing philosophy, current implementation, target state, and roadmap for continuous improvement.

## Current State Assessment

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Framework**: Django's built-in unittest framework (1550+ lines of tests)
- **Test Runner**: Custom `run_tests.sh` with categorized test suites and coverage support
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage reporting with coverage.py (14.71% baseline)
- **Database**: In-memory SQLite for fast test execution
- **Configuration**: Dedicated `test_settings.py` with proper isolation

### Test Coverage Areas

**Excellent Coverage:**
- Core models (Order, OrderItem, Product, FactoryMachineDefinition)
- API endpoints with validation and error handling
- Worker system and batch processing
- UI integration (Bootstrap, notifications, dynamic parameters)
- Background task processing and retry mechanisms

**Well-Covered Areas:**
- Django signals and model lifecycle
- Management commands
- External API integration (mocked)
- End-to-end workflow testing

### Test Organization

Art Factory follows Django's standard test organization with descriptive naming for different test categories:

#### Core Test Files
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure Standards

#### File Organization
- **Main test file**: `main/tests.py` for core functionality
- **Specialized files**: `test_[feature].py` for specific features
- **Naming convention**: Clear, descriptive test method names
- **Documentation**: Docstrings explaining test purpose

#### Test Class Organization
```python
class ModelTestCase(TestCase):
    """Test core model functionality and relationships."""
    
    def setUp(self):
        # Minimal, focused test data setup
        pass
    
    def tearDown(self):
        # Explicit cleanup of files, workers, etc.
        pass
    
    def test_specific_behavior(self):
        """Test one specific behavior with clear assertions."""
        pass
```

### Mock and Isolation Standards

#### External Service Mocking
```python
@patch('fal_client.submit')
@patch('httpx.Client.get')
def test_image_generation(self, mock_get, mock_submit):
    """Always mock external API calls for isolation."""
    mock_submit.return_value = Mock(get=lambda: {'images': [...]})
    # Test implementation
```

#### Database Isolation
- Use Django's `TestCase` for automatic transaction rollback
- In-memory SQLite for fast execution
- No shared state between test methods

#### File System Isolation
```python
@override_settings(MEDIA_ROOT=tempfile.mkdtemp())
def test_file_operations(self):
    """Use temporary directories for file operations."""
    # Test implementation
```

### Performance Testing Standards

#### Load Testing Scenarios
1. **Concurrent Orders**: 10+ simultaneous order submissions
2. **Batch Processing**: Large quantity orders (50+ items)
3. **Worker Scaling**: Multiple workers processing orders
4. **API Stress**: High-frequency API requests

#### Performance Benchmarks
- Order processing: <2 seconds per item
- API response time: <200ms for standard requests
- Database queries: <10 queries per request
- Memory usage: <500MB for batch operations

### Security Testing Requirements

#### Input Validation
- Parameter injection attack prevention
- SQL injection protection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
- File upload validation

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Proper session management
- API key protection
- Access control validation
- Safety checker enforcement

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Art Factory CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.11, 3.12]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install coverage factory-boy hypothesis[django]
    - name: Run tests with coverage
      run: |
        coverage run manage.py test --settings=ai_art_factory.test_settings
        coverage report --fail-under=90
        coverage xml
    - name: Upload coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### Quality Gates
- **Coverage**: Minimum 90% line coverage
- **Performance**: Test suite completes in <2 minutes
- **Reliability**: All tests must pass consistently
- **Security**: Security tests must be included for new features

## Test Organization Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- **test_*.py**: Files containing Django test cases
- **Test case naming**: Descriptive names indicating the component being tested
- **Test method naming**: `test_<specific_behavior>` pattern

### File Organization Principles
1. **Keep related tests together**: UI tests, worker tests, etc. in separate files
2. **Use descriptive file names**: `test_bootstrap_integration.py` vs `test_ui.py`
3. **Follow Django conventions**: All test files in the main app directory
4. **Separate test categories**: Unit tests focus on single components, integration tests on component interaction

### Test File Management
- **Temporary files**: Automatically ignored via .gitignore patterns
- **Log files**: Test execution logs are temporary and not committed
- **Import consistency**: All test files use absolute imports (`from main.models import ...`)

## Test Execution

### Local Development
```bash
# Full test suite
./run_tests.sh all

# Quick tests (excluding integration)
./run_tests.sh quick

# Specific test categories
./run_tests.sh models
./run_tests.sh views
./run_tests.sh integration

# Coverage testing (recommended)
./run_tests.sh coverage           # Run all tests with coverage
./run_tests.sh models --coverage  # Run specific tests with coverage
./run_tests.sh all --coverage     # Run all tests with coverage

# Manual coverage commands
coverage run manage.py test --settings=ai_art_factory.test_settings
coverage report --show-missing
coverage html
```

### Test Categories
- **quick**: Models, views, signals (fast feedback)
- **models**: Django model tests
- **views**: Web view and API tests
- **signals**: Django signal tests
- **tasks**: Background task tests
- **commands**: Management command tests
- **integration**: End-to-end workflow tests
- **batch**: Batch generation tests

## Coverage Reporting

### Overview
Art Factory uses coverage.py for comprehensive test coverage analysis. Coverage reporting helps identify untested code and maintain quality standards.

### Current Coverage Status
- **Baseline Coverage**: 14.71% (as of coverage implementation)
- **Target Coverage**: 90% line coverage, 85% branch coverage
- **Quality Threshold**: 90% required for CI/CD pass

### Coverage Configuration
Coverage is configured via `.coveragerc` with the following key settings:
- **Source**: All project files excluding migrations, tests, and vendor code
- **Reporting**: Shows missing line numbers and generates multiple formats
- **HTML Output**: Detailed reports in `htmlcov/` directory
- **XML Output**: CI/CD compatible format in `coverage.xml`

### Running Coverage
```bash
# Recommended: Use test runner with coverage
./run_tests.sh coverage                 # Full suite with coverage
./run_tests.sh models --coverage        # Specific test with coverage

# Direct coverage commands
coverage run manage.py test --settings=ai_art_factory.test_settings
coverage report --show-missing          # Terminal report
coverage html                          # HTML report (htmlcov/index.html)
coverage xml                           # XML report (coverage.xml)

# Coverage validation
coverage report --fail-under=90        # Check if coverage meets threshold
```

### Coverage Reports
1. **Terminal Report**: Quick summary with missing line numbers
2. **HTML Report**: Interactive browsable report at `htmlcov/index.html`
3. **XML Report**: Machine-readable format for CI/CD integration

### Coverage Analysis Guidelines
- **Focus Areas**: Prioritize coverage for core business logic and models
- **Exclude**: Don't worry about 100% coverage for Django admin, migrations, or settings
- **Critical Paths**: Ensure all API endpoints and worker processes have coverage
- **Edge Cases**: Use coverage gaps to identify missing test scenarios

### Current Coverage Gaps
Based on baseline analysis, the following areas need attention:
- **Views** (11.33%): API endpoints and UI views need comprehensive testing
- **Workers** (0%): Background worker system needs test coverage
- **Tasks** (0%): Async task processing needs testing
- **Management Commands** (0%): CLI commands need validation testing
- **Factory Machines** (0%): Core production logic needs coverage

### Coverage Improvement Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Focus on models and core business logic (target 60%)
2. **Phase 2**: Add view and API endpoint coverage (target 75%)
3. **Phase 3**: Comprehensive worker and task coverage (target 90%)
