# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Art Factory is a Django-first web application for managing AI-generated art using various providers like fal.ai, Replicate, and civitai. The project commits to leveraging Django's mature ecosystem and established patterns to minimize architectural complexity and accelerate development.

## Documentation Structure

The project documentation is organized into focused files:

- **vision.md**: Project purpose, value proposition, and target user
- **concepts.md**: Core domain model and business concepts
- **features.md**: Functional requirements and implementation phases
- **ux.md**: User interface requirements and interaction patterns
- **requirements.md**: Technical requirements and deployment constraints
- **design.md**: Detailed technical architecture (implementation-specific)

## Architecture

### Core Domain Concepts

The application follows a factory abstraction pattern:

- **Products**: Generated media files (images, videos, audio) with metadata
- **Orders**: User requests containing base parameters and production line specification
- **Order Items**: Individual product creation tasks derived from orders
- **Factory Machines**: Provider-specific implementations for generating products
- **Providers**: External AI services (fal.ai, Replicate, civitai)
- **Parameter Sets**: Flexible JSON-based parameter handling for different models

### Component Hierarchy

**Product Factory Inheritance:**
- BaseProductFactory (common validation/infrastructure)
- ProviderProductFactory (provider-specific setup)
- ModelModalityProductFactory (modality-specific logic)
- ModelSpecificFactory (model-specific parameters)

### Key Features

- Smart parameter expansion with token interpolation
- Real-time updates (implementation approach TBD)
- Template and favorites system
- Project organization and management
- Background task processing for production workflows

## Technology Stack

### Core (Committed)
- **Backend Framework**: Django 5.1+
- **Database**: SQLite (development) â†’ PostgreSQL (production migration path)
- **ORM**: Django ORM (built-in)
- **Development Server**: Django's built-in development server

### To Be Determined
- **Real-time Communication**: Options include Django Channels (WebSockets), Server-Sent Events, or polling
- **Background Tasks**: Options include Celery, Django-RQ, or Django's async views
- **Frontend Approach**: Django templates + JavaScript vs. more sophisticated SPA approach
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind, Bootstrap, or custom CSS
- **Task Queue Backend**: Redis, PostgreSQL, or in-memory for development

## Development Environment Setup

### Virtual Environment
The project uses Python's built-in venv for dependency isolation:

```bash
# Create virtual environment (one time setup)
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment (each session)
source venv/bin/activate

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

### Dependencies
```bash
# Install Django and project dependencies
pip install django
pip install fal-client  # AI provider client
```

## Development Workflow

### Terminal Setup
Use **two terminal windows/tabs** for efficient development:

**Terminal 1 - Development Server:**
```bash
cd /Volumes/Ceres/data/Projects/art-factory
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver
# Keep this running - Django auto-reloads on file changes
```

**Terminal 2 - Development Commands:**
```bash
cd /Volumes/Ceres/data/Projects/art-factory
source venv/bin/activate
# Use for migrations, testing, git commands, etc.
```

### Browser Setup
Keep these browser windows open during development:
- **Main Application**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- **Admin Portal**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
- **Auto-refresh** both when making changes

### Initial Setup (One-time)
```bash
# In Terminal 2 - Create admin user
python manage.py createsuperuser
# Recommended: username=admin, email=admin@example.com, password=admin123
```

### Development Cycle
1. Make code changes (models, views, templates)
2. Run migrations if models changed: `python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate`
3. Django auto-reloads development server
4. Refresh browser to test changes
5. Run tests: `python manage.py test`
6. Commit when feature works: `git add . && git commit -m "description"`

## Development Commands

**Note:** Always activate the virtual environment before running Django commands.

```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
source venv/bin/activate

# Development server
python manage.py runserver

# Database operations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Testing
python manage.py test

# Administrative
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py shell
python manage.py collectstatic

# Create requirements file
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Code Organization Patterns

### Models
- Organized as package under `main/models/`
- Separate files for related model groups
- Fat models approach with business logic in model classes

### Views
- Split by section: `[section]_views.py`
- API views separated from template views
- Choose between Django's function-based views or class-based views based on complexity

### Templates
- Base template with section-specific extensions
- Partial templates for reusable components
- Leverage Django's template inheritance and inclusion patterns

### URLs
- Complete pages: `/<section>/`
- HTML partials: `/partials/<resource>/<action>/`
- JSON API: `/api/<resource>/`
- Resource pages: `/<resource>/<id>/`

### Real-time Updates (Architecture TBD)
- Consider Django signals for internal events
- Evaluate Django Channels for WebSocket communication
- Alternative: Server-Sent Events or AJAX polling
- Event naming convention: `(entity)_(verb)` pattern

## Implementation Guidelines

### Parameter Handling
- Use JSON fields for flexible parameter storage
- Validate parameters against ParameterSpec definitions
- Support interpolation and expansion for smart tokens

### Frontend Approach (TBD)
- Option 1: Django templates + minimal JavaScript
- Option 2: Django + modern JavaScript components
- Option 3: Django API + SPA frontend
- Prefer server-side rendering with progressive enhancement

### Database Design
- All models include standard Django fields (id, created/modified timestamps)
- Use Django's JSONField for flexible parameter storage
- Fat models approach with business logic in model classes
- Leverage Django ORM's relationship management

### Error Handling
- Use Django's built-in logging framework
- Leverage Django's exception handling and error pages
- Consider custom error views for user-friendly messages

## Development Principles

### Django-First Approach
- Leverage Django's conventions and built-in features
- Prefer Django ecosystem solutions over external alternatives
- Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- Use Django admin for debugging and data management

### Architecture Guidelines
- Fat models with business logic close to data
- Backwards compatibility not prioritized (favor removing legacy code)
- Choose established patterns over novel approaches
- Minimize non-obvious technical decisions
- Preserve domain concepts while being flexible on implementation

### Documentation-Driven Development
- Well-organized, focused documentation in separate concerns
- Clear separation between vision, domain concepts, features, and technical requirements
- Avoid premature technical specification
- Progressive refinement based on actual implementation needs

### Performance Strategy
- Database optimization using Django ORM best practices
- Efficient file handling for generated media
- Caching strategy using Django's cache framework

## Development Workflow Guidelines

- Always verify accomplishments with tests
- Update documentation to reflect changes
- Check into source code locally before pushing to remote repositories
